<p><div class="aboutFF"><center><b> About Flavourful Fungi</b></center>

Flavourful Fungi LLC was founded in May 2023 in Madison, Mississippi. Frances C. Dancer received a Ph.D. from Mississippi State University where her main focus was in the area of Computer Science with an emphasis in Computer Security/Mobile Device Forensics along with other courses such as Software Engineering, Database, and High Performance Computing, Visualization.
Her mother graduated with a Master of Education from William Carey University where she taught elementary school for 38+ years in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Frances wanted to be just like her mother, but at an advanced level of education. Jackson State University had several openings for a Computer Science Professor, which is her alma mater, and Frances has been educating youthful minds ever since.
While instructing, she advises, recruits, and motivates adults of under-served populations, pointing them in the right direction when asked about graduate school or employment. She also started thinking about the direction she should proceed after retirement.
Frances was raised in an under-served population where her father was centered around agriculture, whose actual major at Alcorn State University was a Bachelor of Science of Agriculture. Her family (including herself) spent almost every Saturday pulled and shucking corn, picking field peas and butter beans and shelling them, pulling okra, radishes, cucumbers, and hot peppers, and picking greens in order to have fresh, nutritious, and sustainable resource for her family. If there was a surplus of vegetables, her father sold them to market.
Since she has an essence of both her father and her mother, then mushroom farming is an exceptional idea. Frances and her family will be focused on aiding in the extinction of food desserts in under-served populations while educating the public about gourmet mushrooms As always, the family looks forward to meeting our next customer which we hope it is you!
